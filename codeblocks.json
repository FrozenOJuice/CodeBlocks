    "explanation": "This code sets up a FastAPI backend server designed to work with a Next.js frontend, featuring authentication routes mounted under the \"/auth\" prefix and basic API endpoints for root access and health checks. The application is configured with CORS middleware to securely allow cross-origin requests from the frontend development server, enabling seamless communication between the separate frontend and backend services during development. The structure provides a clean foundation for building a full-stack application with organized routing and proper cross-origin request handling.",
